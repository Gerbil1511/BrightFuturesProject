## Project Outline

Bright Futures is a fictional organisation dedicated to the providing parents and teachers with resources and information to support their conversations around diveristy and inclusion to children of primary school age. The webpage developed for this organisation provides clear and concise basic concepts, a list of tips, details about the organisation's mission statement, testimonials/reviews, a variety of resources and links to further research, contact details, plus an oppotunity to book a talk with a Bright Future's Diversity and Inclusion ambassador or to volunteer to become one. The webpage is well-designed and easy-to-navigate, appealing, responsive across multiple devices and adheres to accessibility standards.


## UX Design

The following details are based upon the 5 planes of user experience (UX). The five planes of user experience (UX) are a framework for UX design that are stacked on top of each other, from abstract to concrete and credited to be developed by Jesse James Garrett, author of The Elements of User Experience.   

## Strategy: The most abstract plane, where you balance business objectives with user needs. This is where you determine long-term and short-term goals, and what users will want from the product in the form of User Stories. 

User Stories: 

1: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to NAVIGATE EASILY through the website so that I can FIND THE INFORMATION I need.

2: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to see HIGH QUAITY IMAGES and ENGAGING DESCRIPTIONS of Diversity & Inclusion concepts so that I can get a VISUAL UNDERSTANDING of how to teach these concepts to my child/classroom of children.

3: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to UNDERSTAND THE BASIC CONCEPTS of diversity and inclusion so that I can EXPLAIN THEM to my child/classroom of children.

4: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to FIND RESOURCES that teach diversity and inclusion to primary school age children so that I can INTEGRATE THESE CONCEPTS into conversations with my child/classroom of children.

5: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to FIND RELEVANT LINKS to other research that support diversity and inclusion so that I can EXPLORE MORE IN-DEPTH information.

6: As a SITE USER, I need to FIND ESSENTIAL CONTACT INFORMATION details so that I can GET SUPPORT, PROVIDE FEEDBACK, or EXPLORE SOCIAL MEDIA presence.

7: As a PARENT/TEACHER I want to book a talk from, or volunteer to be, a diversity and inclusion ambassador, using a simple booking inquiry form, so I can organise a visit or get involved.

8: As a PARENT/TEACHER I want to RECEIVE NEWSLETTERS OR UPDATES about new resources and content so that I can STAY INFORMED about diversity and inclusion.

9: As a PROSPECTIVE VOLUNTEER/CUSTOMER, I want to read testimonials and reviews from other customers/volunteers, so I can gauge the experiences of others and feel more confident about booking a talk or becoming a volunteer.

### Responsive Design

Used [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) rather than needing media queries.
used dec tools to check

During testing it was apparent that `display-6` was too large for the navbar brand text so this was removed to increase responsivity.

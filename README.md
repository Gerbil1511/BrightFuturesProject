## Introduction 

For my first individual formative HTML, CSS & Bootstrap assignment for the Code Institute AI Augmented FullStack Bootcamp, I created a project based upon the goals and features proposed in Project 1: "Diversity & Inclusion".

## Project Outline

Bright Futures is a fictional organisation dedicated to the providing parents and teachers with resources and information to support their conversations around diveristy and inclusion to children of primary school age. The webpage developed for this organisation provides clear and concise basic concepts, a list of tips, details about the organisation's mission statement, testimonials/reviews, a variety of resources and links to further research, contact details, plus an oppotunity to book a talk with a Bright Future's Diversity and Inclusion ambassador or to volunteer to become one. The webpage is well-designed and easy-to-navigate, appealing, responsive across multiple devices and adheres to accessibility standards.


## UX Design

The following details are based upon the 5 planes of user experience (UX). The five planes of user experience (UX) are a framework for UX design that are stacked on top of each other, from abstract to concrete and credited to be developed by Jesse James Garrett, author of The Elements of User Experience.  


## Strategy: The most abstract plane, where you balance business objectives with user needs. This is where you determine long-term and short-term goals, and what users will want from the product in the form of User Stories. 

User Stories: 

1: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to NAVIGATE EASILY through the website so that I can FIND THE INFORMATION I need.

2: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to see HIGH QUAITY IMAGES and ENGAGING DESCRIPTIONS of Diversity & Inclusion concepts so that I can get a VISUAL UNDERSTANDING of how to teach these concepts to my child/classroom of children.

3: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to UNDERSTAND THE BASIC CONCEPTS of diversity and inclusion so that I can EXPLAIN THEM to my child/classroom of children.

4: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to FIND RESOURCES that teach diversity and inclusion to primary school age children so that I can INTEGRATE THESE CONCEPTS into conversations with my child/classroom of children.

5: As a PARENT/TEACHER, I want to FIND RELEVANT LINKS to other research that support diversity and inclusion so that I can EXPLORE MORE IN-DEPTH information.

6: As a SITE USER, I need to FIND ESSENTIAL CONTACT INFORMATION details so that I can GET SUPPORT, PROVIDE FEEDBACK, or EXPLORE SOCIAL MEDIA presence.

7: As a PARENT/TEACHER I want to book a talk from, or volunteer to be, a diversity and inclusion ambassador, using a simple booking inquiry form, so I can organise a visit or get involved.

8: As a PARENT/TEACHER I want to RECEIVE NEWSLETTERS OR UPDATES about new resources and content so that I can STAY INFORMED about diversity and inclusion.

9: As a PROSPECTIVE VOLUNTEER/CUSTOMER, I want to read testimonials and reviews from other customers/volunteers, so I can gauge the experiences of others and feel more confident about booking a talk or becoming a volunteer.

## Scope: You transform strategy into requirements by defining the product or service's characteristics. This is where you determine what features will be integral to the product.

## Features


#### Navigation, Links and Hero Section

All users require the navigation to be clear and simple to follow and, therefore Bootstrap navigation bars was the perfect choice for this. The navigation bar is fixed at all times on every section and every page. Links are all connected and open in a new page. Each page has a striking hero section that to appeal to users.


#### Bootstrap Cards

I utilised Bootsrap cards throughout the information sections and resources, as it ensured that the information was displayed clearly and cleanly making it easy to navigate and appealing to the user.


#### Book a talk/Volunteer Section

I opted to create a new fresh page for the form as opposed to a modal to ensure that validation of input fields was possible on submit button. It didn't seem to work correctly in the modal format and accepted blank fields. The form is also responsive across all devices.


#### Footer

Utilised the Bootstrap 5.3 footer and added the logo as a link to ensure that users could navigate to the top of the page from here. Ensured that social links were also available. the responisvity of the footer works correctly across all devices.

## Structure: This is where you arrange the site's functions. 

This website has a clear and intuitive navigation menu that makes it easy for users to find what they need via a navigation bar with links to "Home," "Research," "Resources," "Contact," and "Book a talk/Volunteer."
The content is organized in a logical and accessible manner, with clear headings and dropdown sections with "Resources" categorized by type (book recommendations, activities, videos).

Going forward I would add a search function, as that would also benfit the user to quickly find specific resources or information.

## Skeleton: This is where you design the placement of buttons, tabs, photos, and text blocks

### Wireframes

I designed the website using wireframes by utilising the Balsamiq software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the User Design Skeleton process. I initially designed with mobile first-in mind which led to the desktop design. The design for small tablets reflects the mobile design and large tablets reflect the desktop design.

## Surface: This is the most concrete plane. Design, colours, typography.


### Main Colour Palette

A selection of colours reflected the colourful nature f teh imagery throughout the site: 

- rgba(241, 222, 128, 0.7) Light yellow
- rgba(153, 241, 143, 0.7)  Light green
- rgba(128, 198, 241, 0.7)  Light blue
- rgba(241, 139, 128, 0.7)  Light red

Also some Bootstrap colours were also used as borders around cards.

## Fonts

 I ustilised the original fonts for this website to ensure accessibility was maintained at all times. I tested with a variety of fonts however none were as readable as the default fonts.



## Images

It was important that the images reflect the  brand especially as the fictional brand is called Bright Futures, it was essential that imagery reflected positivity, empathy, inclusion and diversity.

As the site is aimed at parents and teachers of young children, the imagery needed to reflect the approriate age range, and symbolise the fact that Bright Futures is an educational resource.



### Responsive Design

Using [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) alongside CSS media queries meant that I could achievefor full responsivity across devices. However, this took some time to get the positions of elements just right

Chrome Dev Tools was used frequently as were mobile and tablet devices, at each push stage of teh code.

During testing it was apparent that some images were too skewed in the viewport so utilised CSS to make the responsivity of the images more appealing.

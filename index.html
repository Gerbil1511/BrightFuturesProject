                                <p class="card-text"><strong>Diversity</strong> is when there are many different
                                    kinds of
                                    people, things,
                                    or ideas all
                                    together. Imagine you have a big box of crayons with lots of different
                                    colors like red,
                                    blue, green, and
                                    yellow. Each color is
                                    unique and special in its own way, and when you use all of them together,
                                    you can create
                                    a beautiful and
                                    interesting picture.In the same way, people are different too.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Some have different skin colors, some speak different languages and some
                                    have different
                                    customs or
                                    traditions. This diversity makes the world a more interesting and
                                    fun place to live in, just like how all the different crayon colors make
                                    your picture
                                    special. So,
                                    diversity is all about celebrating and appreciating all the unique things
                                    that make each
                                    person special.

                                    are. Imagine you're playing a game with your friends, and you make sure that
                                    every
                                    single person gets
                                    to join in and have fun. You don't leave anyone out, and you make sure
                                    everyone feels
                                    happy and part of

                                    In the same way, inclusion means making sure that everyone, no matter what
                                    they look
                                    like, where they
                                    come from, or what they can do, feels like they belong. It's about being
                                    kind,
                                    respectful, and making
                                    sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and enjoy things together.
                                    So,
                                    inclusion is all about
                                    creating a friendly and fair environment where everyone feels valued and
                                    included.

                    <p>Ethnic Representation in Children's Literature:
                        A recent report by the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) titled "Reflecting
                        Realities" provides insights into the representation of racially minoritised characters in UK
                        children's literature. The report shows a significant increase in inclusive literature, with 30%
                        of children's titles published in 2022 featuring racially minoritised characters, up from 4% in
                        2017. However, it also notes a decrease in the presence of these characters in picturebooks and
                        non-fiction for the first time.
<br>
                        Children's Experiences with Diversity in Books
                        The Literacy Trust's report, "Seeing yourself in what you read: diversity and children and young
                        people's reading in 2022," reveals that nearly 2 in 5 children and young people find it
                        difficult to find books with characters or people like them. This difficulty is more pronounced
                        among children from Black ethnic backgrounds and those receiving free school meals.
<br>
                        Diversity and Inclusion in Schools
                        Pearson UK's "Diversity and inclusion in schools report" highlights that 80% of UK teachers
                        believe more can be done to celebrate diverse cultures, people, and experiences in education.
                        The report emphasizes the need for greater inclusion to reflect the diverse backgrounds of
                        students.

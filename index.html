                                <p class="card-text"><strong>Diversity</strong> means understanding that
                                    everyone is different. Whether they come from different backgrounds, different
                                    countries, or more. Diversity encompasses everything from ethnicity, gender
                                    identity, sex, sexuality, race, religion, and economic status amongst others.

                                    <br>
                                    A diverse community is a wonderful thing that should be celebrated. It ensures that
                                    everyone is free to be themselves without being fearful of prejudice. It also allows
                                    us to build relationships with others while embracing what makes us all unique.

                                <p class="card-text"><strong>Inclusion</strong> is when everyone feels welcome
                                    and included,

                                    different they
                                    are. Imagine you're playing a game with your friends, and you make sure that
                                    every
                                    single person gets
                                    to join in and have fun. You don't leave anyone out, and you make sure
                                    everyone feels
                                    happy and part of

                                    In the same way, inclusion means making sure that everyone, no matter what
                                    they look
                                    like, where they
                                    come from, or what they can do, feels like they belong. It's about being
                                    kind,
                                    respectful, and making
                                    sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and enjoy things together.
                                    So,
                                    inclusion is all about
                                    creating a friendly and fair environment where everyone feels valued and
                                    included.
